**autoScript** is a Linux program, specifically designed for Kali Linux, that takes common WiFi attacks and automates them into one easy to use program.



## Install
Installation is simple just download or clone the repository and in the folder run:

    cd autoScript
    bash ./install

## Use
The autoScript commands are:

    autoScript
    autoScript run
    autoScript update
    autoScript uninstall
    autoScript help

Most of the tools in autoScript are very simple, most of it is automated and ive tried to make it very user friendly. A small tip though; when you are captureing a handshake of a network (the most efficient way to crack a network with autoScript) you need a device to join the network. You can force this scenario by deauthing any device on that network (also an option in autoScript) for 3 seconds or so. Just open another terminal before starting the capture and select a target to deauth. Make sure they are on the same network you are trying to break into to. Education purposes only lol.
